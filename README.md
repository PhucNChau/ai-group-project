# Introduction
## Datasets
Basic datasets are selected because of the limited of computing power of personal machine.
- CIFAR10
- MNIST

## Optimization methods for DL
Popular optimation methods are selected as follows:
- SGD
- Adam
- AdaMax
- Select an algorithm to build it and compare with other built-in optimizers: Adam - [Link to the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980)
